# Computational Game Theory - 2022 - Assignment 3 

Here you will find the code for the assignment 3. You have to complete the empty functions/methods based on the signatures and docstring.

WARNING: YOU SHOULD NOT CHANGE THE FUNCTIONS NAMES AND THE FUNCTIONS SHOULD RESPECT THEIR SIGNATURE.

You are free to add functions and methods, however you should properly comment them.

## First task

Complete the `student.py` file with your first and last names and your student number.

## Exercise 1: Frozen Lake

In the directory `frozen_lake` you will find two files: 
- `agents.py`: The main file you need to complete.
- `runner.py`: The training loop for Q-Learning is already given to you, you need to adapt it to SARSA. You should add your code to create the plots here, and running `python runner.py` should train an agent.

## Exercise 2: Commitment sequences

In the directory `commitment` you wil find five files:
- `matrix_games.py`: The file containing the matrix game environment class.
- `iql_agent.py`: The file for your Independent Q-Learners agents' class.
- `iql_runner.py`: This time you need to code the training loop, use `frozen_lake/runner.py` as inspiration. Running `python iql_runner.py` should train the IQL agents.
- `commitment_agent.py`: The file for your Commitment agents' class.
- `commitment_runner.py`: You should code the training loop. Running `python commitment_runner.py` should train the Commitment agents.

# Additional information:

- With regards to the following part in the assignment:
"A plot containing the return of the agent during training and the return at all evaluation times should be included in the report. This plot should be averaged over 20 full training runs with standard deviations as error bars."  You can plot the two plots in one figure. So I would advise you to plot first the training returns (the mean over 20 runs), with x-values being something like 100, 200, 300, ... and y-values then being the average of the last 100 returns. Using 100 (or 200 or whatever) episodes is to make the plot a bit more readable compared to just plotting at every episode. Then again plt.plot(x, y, ...), but now for the evaluation returns, where the x-values are 1000, 2000, 3000, etc., and the y-values are the average returns of the 32 evaluation episodes (and then take the mean of these averages again over the 20 runs and calculate the stdevs). Make sure that all the means of your runs (training and evaluation) are visible within your stdevs. The easiest way to do this is to make your stdevs more transparent in the settings of your plot.
